# Poll App

This is a polling web app that I made to screw around with Node and Angular.

To run it locally, you need to have Node.js and Gulp CLI installed. Then you run these commands:
```bash
cd poll-app

#Install dependencies. On Windows, you'll need to run this one as an administrator without sudo.
sudo npm install

#Build the client-side app
gulp build-client

#Start the server
npm start

#Go to localhost:3000 in a browser
```
