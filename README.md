# Poll App

This is a polling web app that I made to screw around with Node and Angular.

To run it locally, you need to have NPM and Gulp CLI installed. Then you run these commands:
```bash
cd poll-app

#Install dependencies
npm install

#Build the client-side app
gulp build-client

#Start the server
npm start
```
